                    <p> Chicago is a must-see city perfect for a fun weekend. There are so many things to do, my favorite including going up 
                        in the Sears Tower and walking around by the river walk where you can enjoy the beautiful views.</p>

                        The Carpathian mountains stretch across the SouthWestern corner of Ukraine, and in 2020,
                        I climbed the tallest mountain in Ukraine, Hoverla, at 2,061 meters high. </p>
